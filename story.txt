Once upon a time there lived a monkey on a jamoon tree near the river banks. One day a crocodile came
out of the river and went to the monkey's tree. He said he is been travelling for day and is very hungry.

The kind monkey gave some jamoons form the tree. The crocodile was very happy and thanked him. He asked
if he could visit the monkey again.
